# Portfolio-Website
A website incorporating my Portfolio, my current semester timetable and a few course videos on a separate tab.
I've created few web documents (in HTML) and three stylesheets (in CSS),
index.html – a page describing my portfolio
mytimetable.html – a page displaying my current semester timetable in tables
coursevideos.html – a page displaying 6 videos of html and css(random videos linked by youtube)
